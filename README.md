 1. The full project was done in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX at frontend.
 2. PHP as Scripting Language.
 3. MySQL as the database and Apache as the Server.



> **Note:**

> - Create database '6339'
> - Import 'patientsnew' .sql file in the newly created database.
> - Edit retrieve.php file and enter the details.
> - "mysqli_connect('*hostname*','*username*','*password*','6339')".
> - Copy the 'ProjectNo2' folder into the www folder of localhost.
> - Start wampserver.
> - Go to link localhost/ProjectNo2/index.php
